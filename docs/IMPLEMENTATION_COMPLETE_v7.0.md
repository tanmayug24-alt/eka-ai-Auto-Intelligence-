# EKA-AI v7.0 - Critical Requirements Implementation

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Frontend-Backend API Integration

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Changes:

- Updated `frontend/src/api.js` with missing endpoints:

  - `listInvoices()` - GET /api/v1/invoices

  - `getInvoice(id)` - GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}

  - `getInvoiceByJob(jobId)` - GET /api/v1/invoices/job/{jobId}

  - `createInvoice(data)` - POST /api/v1/invoices

  - `markInvoicePaid(id)` - POST /api/v1/invoices/{id}/pay

  - `listApprovals()` - GET /api/v1/approvals

  - `respondToApproval(token, decision, reason)` - POST /api/v1/approvals/{token}/respond

### Backend Endpoints (Already Implemented):

- ✅ Dashboard: `/api/v1/dashboard/workshop`

- ✅ Invoices: `/api/v1/invoices/*`

- ✅ Approvals: `/api/v1/approvals/*`

- ✅ Job Cards: `/api/v1/job-cards/*`

### Frontend Pages (Already Implemented):

- ✅ `DashboardPage.jsx` - Fetches from `/api/v1/dashboard/workshop`

- ✅ `InvoicesPage.jsx` - Full CRUD with backend

- ✅ `ApprovalsPage.jsx` - List, view, approve/reject

---

### 2. Job State Transition UI

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Core BRD Requirement)

**Component:** `frontend/src/components/JobCardStateTransition.jsx`

### Features:

- ✅ FSM-based state transitions with validation

- ✅ Visual state flow (current → next)

- ✅ Dropdown with only valid next states

- ✅ API integration: `PATCH /api/v1/job-cards/{id}/transition`

- ✅ Error handling with user feedback

- ✅ Real-time job card refresh after transition

### Valid State Flow:

```text
OPEN → DIAGNOSIS → ESTIMATE_PENDING → APPROVAL_PENDING → APPROVED → 
REPAIR → QC_PDI → READY → INVOICED → PAID → CLOSED

```text

### Integration:

- Used in `JobCardDetailPage.jsx` (Status tab)

- Callback updates parent component on successful transition

- Prevents invalid transitions at UI level

---

### 3. MG Engine Matrices Population

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Script:** `scripts/seed_mg_engine.py`

### Data Seeded:

- ✅ **10 MG Formulas** with variants:

  - Tata Nexon (XE, XM, XZ+) - Diesel & Petrol

  - Maruti Swift (LXI, VXI, ZXI) - Petrol

  - Hyundai Creta (E, SX) - Petrol & Diesel

  - Mahindra Scorpio (S11) - Diesel

- ✅ **12 City Indices** with tier-based multipliers:

  - Tier 1: Mumbai (1.15), Delhi (1.12), Bangalore (1.10), etc.

  - Tier 2: Ahmedabad (1.02), Jaipur (1.00), Lucknow (0.98)

  - Tier 3: Nagpur (0.95)

### Wear/Tear Calculation:

- Base cost varies by make/model/variant

- City multiplier applied based on location

- Parts/Labor split: 65%/35%

### Run Command:

```bash
python scripts/seed_mg_engine.py

```text

---

### 4. Variant Field Addition

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Model:** `app/modules/vehicles/model.py`

### Changes:

- ✅ `variant` field already exists in Vehicle model

- ✅ Type: `String`, nullable=True

- ✅ Used in MG calculations for accurate cost estimation

**Migration:** `migrations/versions/cd8c1207ce67_add_variant_to_vehicles.py`

### Impact:

- MG Engine can now match exact vehicle variant

- More accurate maintenance cost predictions

- Supports variant-specific formulas

---

### 5. Load Testing Infrastructure

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Files Created:

1. `tests/load_test.py` - Locust-based load test

2. `scripts/run_load_test.py` - Test runner with reporting

3. `scripts/verify_requirements.py` - Comprehensive verification

### Load Test Scenarios:

- Health checks (weight: 3)

- Job card listing (weight: 2)

- Dashboard queries (weight: 2)

- Vehicle listing (weight: 1)

- Invoice listing (weight: 1)

### Target Metrics:

- 100 RPS sustained

- < 5% error rate

- < 100ms p95 response time

### Run Commands:

```bash

# Quick test (100 requests)

python scripts/verify_requirements.py

# Full load test (requires locust)

pip install locust
python scripts/run_load_test.py

# Or use locust directly

locust -f tests/load_test.py --headless -u 50 -r 10 -t 30s --host <http://localhost:8000>

```text

---

## 🚀 Verification Script

**File:** `scripts/verify_requirements.py`

### Checks:

1. ✅ MG formulas count (>= 5)

2. ✅ City indices count (>= 5)

3. ✅ Variant field in formulas

4. ✅ Vehicle model has variant field

5. ✅ Frontend API endpoints present
6. ✅ Job state transition UI exists
7. ✅ Quick load test (50+ RPS)

### Run:

```bash
python scripts/verify_requirements.py

```text

---

## 🔧 Setup & Verification (One Command)

**File:** `setup_and_verify.ps1`

### Steps:

1. Seeds MG Engine data

2. Runs database migrations

3. Verifies all requirements

4. Provides next steps

### Run:

```powershell

.\setup_and_verify.ps1

```text

## 📝 Notes

- All backend endpoints already existed and are working

- Frontend was missing API client methods - now added

- MG seeding script enhanced with comprehensive data

- Load testing infrastructure ready for 10k workshop claim validation

- Variant field was already in model, just needed data population
